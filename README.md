AnkiRPG
=======
A turn based, color coded party, monster collecting, rpg for learning and memorization

Genre Overview
--------------
Each turn, you perform a color coded "player test" among a number of options. If successful, members of your party bearing the same color as said option get to attack the enemy. If you fail, you lose your turn. Either way, the enemy responds in kind during their turn, though computer opponents have attack cooldowns instead of "player tests".

In addition, progression primarily consists of party members being collected, leveled, evolved, and combined.

Player Test Types
--------------------
These are popular types in the genre:

1. Quiz RPG - The test is answering a multiple choice trivia question, and color options are trivia categories.
2. Puzzles & Dragons - The test is creating a match-3 game match, and the color used is the color of the gems matched.

These are supported by AnkiRPG:

1. AnkiRPG - The test is reviewing a flashcard in Anki, and the color option is the card's model/deck (ie. "category").
2. NoTest - There is no player performed test/color and instead party members use simple cooldowns for attacks. This is what computer opponents use.
